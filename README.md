# NewsIndexer

This project aims to build a News indexer with the following goals:
- Parse simple news articles with minimal markup
- Index a decent sized subset of the given news corpus.
- Create multiple indexes on the news articles as well as metadata.
- Provide an index introspection mechanism that can later be built upon to support queries.
